# Boozehound

Boozehound is a collection of cocktail and drink recipes. Search and filter over 500 drinks by over 400 ingredients. Powered by [TheCocktailDB](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php).

## Background

After growing frustrated with the half empty bottles in our home bar, I decided we needed a way to easily explore cocktail and drink recipes. I was unsatisfied with the search and filter tools in the existing cocktail recipe sites, so I decided to build a UI for [TheCocktailDB](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php) that fit our use case.
